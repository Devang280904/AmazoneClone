# AmazoneClone
This is my first Project using HTML and CSS.
This project is a fully responsive clone of the Amazon homepage, built using HTML and CSS. The design closely replicates the original layout and structure of Amazon's homepage, including the navigation bar, search bar, banner, product grid, and footer.
